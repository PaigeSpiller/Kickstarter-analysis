# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
Kickstarter data analysis in order to determine trends in crowdfunded projects

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
The pupose of this analysis is to assess crowdfunding data in order to determine what types of theater projects were successful in reaching their goals.  In this analysis, we will look at project launch dates and project funding goals in order to determine if the timing of the crowdfunding campaign and the monetary goal had any impact on the success of the campaign. This data analysis will be a useful resource to anyone considering a theater crowdfunding campaign.  

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
The launch date of a theater crowdfunding campaign had a noticable impact on the success of the project. Campaigns that were initiated in the second quarter of the year (Apr-Jun) saw the highest rates of success with an average success rate of 65%.  Within the second quarter, the most successful month was June, with a success rate of 67%. Converseley, campaigns that were started in the last quarter of the year (Oct-Dec) only had an average success rate of 56%.  December was notably the least favorable month to start a campaign in, with a success rate of 49%.  Campaigns in both the first and third quarters of the year had success rates of 61%.  The below chart demonstrates the seasonal impact of the success of the timing of theater crowdfunding campaigns with peaks in the springtime and early summer and dropoffs in the winter months.
