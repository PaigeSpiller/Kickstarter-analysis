# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
Kickstarter data analysis in order to determine trends in theater crowdfunded projects

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
The pupose of this analysis is to assess crowdfunding data in order to determine what types of theater projects were successful in reaching their goals.  In this analysis, we will look at project launch dates and project funding goals in order to determine if the timing of the crowdfunding campaign and the monetary goal had any impact on the success of the campaign. This data analysis will be a useful resource to anyone considering a theater crowdfunding campaign.  

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
The launch date of a theater crowdfunding campaign had a noticable impact on the success of the project. Campaigns that were initiated in the second quarter of the year (Apr-Jun) saw the highest rates of success with an average success rate of 65%.  Within the second quarter, the most successful month was June, with a success rate of 67%. Converseley, campaigns that were started in the last quarter of the year (Oct-Dec) only had an average success rate of 56%.  December was notably the least favorable month to start a campaign in, with a success rate of 49%.  Campaigns in both the first and third quarters of the year had success rates of 61%.  The below chart demonstrates the seasonal impact of the success of the timing of theater crowdfunding campaigns with peaks in the springtime and early summer and dropoffs in the winter months.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
The funding goal of a theater campaign impacted the overall success rate.  In general, lower funding goals cooresponded with higher rates of successful campaigns. Notably, campaigns under $5,000 saw great success with an average success rate of 68%. Once campaign goals reached $20,000 the rate of failure exceeded the rate of success (with a few exceptions).  These exceptions fell within the funding goal bracket of $35,000 - $49,999 and will be discussed in the limitations section below.  Overall, the average failure rate of a campaign over $20,000 was 66%. The below graph shows the coorelation between the funding goal set and the success of a theater campaign.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
Challenges or difficulties that were encountered, and how they were overcome, are well explained. If there were no difficulties, describe any possible challenges or difficulties that could be encountered

## Results
In conclusion, the analysis above shows several factors to consider in order to acheive a successful theater crowdfunding campaign.  One important factor is the timing of the launch of the campaign.  To increase chances of success, a recommendation would be to start your campaign in the second quarter of the year (Apr-Jun), preferably in June, the month with the highest rate of campaign successes.  A second recommendation, would be to avoid initiating a theater campaign in the last quarter of the year (Oct-Dec) as these months saw the lowest rates of success.  

In addition to considering the timing of your theater campaign, the funding goal set can also impact the success of the campaign.  Consider creating a campaign below $5,000 for the highest chance of success.
